An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.
 It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. 
A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.

If class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement then it means that we declare class instance that are available for all 
object and it can be accesssed by their class name.

It's because one needs to define something that is NOT done in the base-class' init , 
and the only possibility to obtain that is to put its execution in a derived-class' init function.

You can then dynamically replace (update) the parents to achieve the desired effect.

Local scope is the area between an { and it's closing }. Function scope is the area between the opening { of a function and its closing }, 
which may contain more "local" scopes.
