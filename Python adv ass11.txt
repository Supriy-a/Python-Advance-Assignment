*******************************************************************************************
A way to declare a classâ€™ metaclass is by using metaclass keyword in class definition.
class meta(type):
    pass
class class_meta(metaclass=meta):
    pass
print(type(meta))
print(type(class_meta))

Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the "decorator function", i.e., the one that 
takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!).
